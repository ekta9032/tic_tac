# tic_tac
A simple and interactive implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. This project allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid, either in the console or via a graphical user interface (GUI). It includes basic game mechanics like alternating turns, checking for win conditions, and declaring a winner or a draw.
